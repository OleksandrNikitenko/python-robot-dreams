# ~~Shit~~ Random number generator
A small script to generate a pseudo-random number in the 1-100 range created for the [Robot Dreams](https://robotdreams.cc/uk) shit-coder 2024 contest.<br>
With this script you can generate either a single number or a series of numbers.

# Prerequisites
Python3 needs to be installed in your OS.<br>
Tested with [Python3.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-390/), so this one is the min recommended version to use.

# Usage
1) Clone the project
2) Navigate to the project directory
3) Run the main.py file with python. For a single number: `python main.py`, for a series of numbers: `python main.py <desired_number>`
